  abstract = {Optical-field profiles in wide-band-gap AlxGa1-xN/InxGa1-xN multiple-quantum well (MQW) separate-confinement heterostructure (SCH) laser diodes (LDs) were calculated using a 2{\texttimes}2 transfer-matrix approach that accommodates complex refractive indices. The refractive indices of AlxGa1-xN and InxGa1-xN were approximated by shifting the refractive index of GaN according to the band-gap energy of the solid solution. Current LDs were analyzed and show reasonable optical confinement. Optimization of the SCH waveguide for a three MQW active region was performed by varying the waveguide and cladding layer thicknesses. For 0.8{$\mu$}m thick Al0.10Ga0.90N cladding layers, waveguides on sapphire and SiC substrates had a maximum confinement factor of {$\sim$}3.3\%. Layers outside of the waveguide strongly affected the optical field for thin ({$\sim$}0.4{\enspace}{$\mu$}m) cladding layer thicknesses and resulted in resonant coupling of the light out of the waveguide. Sapphire substrates were found to enhance light confinement, while SiC substrates were found to reduce optical confinement as the cladding layer thickness is reduced.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Light is often characterized only by its classical properties, like intensity or coherence. When looking at its quantum properties, described by photon correlations, new information about the state of the matter generating the radiation can be revealed. In particular the difference between independent and entangled emitters, which is at the heart of quantum mechanics, can be made visible in the photon statistics of the emitted light. The well-studied phenomenon of superradiance occurs when quantum--mechanical correlations between the emitters are present. Notwithstanding, superradiance was previously demonstrated only in terms of classical light properties. Here, we provide the missing link between quantum correlations of the active material and photon correlations in the emitted radiation. We use the superradiance of quantum dots in a cavity-quantum electrodynamics laser to show a direct connection between superradiant pulse emission and distinctive changes in the photon correlation function. This directly demonstrates the importance of quantum--mechanical correlations and their transfer between carriers and photons in novel optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract = {Low energy consumption nanolasers are crucial for advancing on-chip integrated optical interconnects and photonic integrated circuits. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional semiconductor materials for nanolaser optical gain medium, promising ultralow lasing threshold powers. While several studies suggest that TMDs meet the criteria for lasing, whether true lasing has been achieved remains a topic of heavy debate within the scientific community. In this perspective, we offer an overview of the field, outlining the key characteristics of laser light and methods for testing these properties in TMD-based devices. We then conduct a thorough review of recent reports claiming lasing, assessing the findings against established criteria for laser light emission. Finally, we discuss future research directions and applications, highlighting the key challenges that must be addressed to realize practical TMD-based nanolasers.},
