  abstract = {Abstract             Light is often characterized only by its classical properties, like intensity or coherence. When looking at its quantum properties, described by photon correlations, new information about the state of the matter generating the radiation can be revealed. In particular the difference between independent and entangled emitters, which is at the heart of quantum mechanics, can be made visible in the photon statistics of the emitted light. The well-studied phenomenon of superradiance occurs when quantum--mechanical correlations between the emitters are present. Notwithstanding, superradiance was previously demonstrated only in terms of classical light properties. Here, we provide the missing link between quantum correlations of the active material and photon correlations in the emitted radiation. We use the superradiance of quantum dots in a cavity-quantum electrodynamics laser to show a direct connection between superradiant pulse emission and distinctive changes in the photon correlation function. This directly demonstrates the importance of quantum--mechanical correlations and their transfer between carriers and photons in novel optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract = {Low energy consumption nanolasers are crucial for advancing on-chip integrated optical interconnects and photonic integrated circuits. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional semiconductor materials for nanolaser optical gain medium, promising ultralow lasing threshold powers. While several studies suggest that TMDs meet the criteria for lasing, whether true lasing has been achieved remains a topic of heavy debate within the scientific community. In this perspective, we offer an overview of the field, outlining the key characteristics of laser light and methods for testing these properties in TMD-based devices. We then conduct a thorough review of recent reports claiming lasing, assessing the findings against established criteria for laser light emission. Finally, we discuss future research directions and applications, highlighting the key challenges that must be addressed to realize practical TMD-based nanolasers.},

The demand for such 					ultimate single-mode high-brightness semiconductor lasers is 					increasing for a wide variety of emerging applications including 					next-generation remote sensing for smart mobility and high-precision 					laser processing for smart manufacturing. Photonic-crystal 					surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs) show promise to meet these demands, 					based on their broad-area coherent two-dimensional (2D) resonance at a 					singularity ({$\Gamma$}) point of their 2D photonic band structure. In this 					tutorial paper, the lasing principle, theoretical analysis, and 					experimental demonstration of PCSELs are described. Recent progress in 					PCSEL development, including the formulation of a design guideline for 					realizing 100-W-to-kW-class single-mode operation, the experimental 					demonstration of a brightness of 1 GW cm               --2               sr               --1               , 					and an extension of the lasing wavelengths to telecommunication and 					mid-infrared wavelengths are also covered.},
